# Laptop-Price-Prediction-
The most widespread use of laptops can be seen in our daily life, where we take advantage of these devices for various purposes. Generally, theyÂ help people in internet banking, online recharge, bill payment, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, online education, internet surfing, etc.

**Problem domain**
The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop  then we set an algorithm(Model) which is  compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations. We develop a Model , for  the .dataset ,which is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing.

**Scope of the project**

To identify if different categories of person would prefer to have different features in a laptop .
The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop then our model predict should be compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations.

**Statistical technique used**

Exploratory Data analysis

Linear regression

Lasso regression

Ridge regression

Random forest regression

**CONCLUSION**

With 88% Training Accuracy and 93% Testing Accuracy, Random Forest has proven to be the most efficient model out of the algorithms used in our model, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression,  and Random Forest.


 Hence Random Forest will give best accuracy among all. That means the prediction based on these model will be accurate and near to the actual value.
